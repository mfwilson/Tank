PythonTank
==========

A lightweight (inversion of control container)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control] for Python, inspired by the [Castle project's](http://www.castleproject.org/) [Windsor container](http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx).

Why?
====

Having spent the majority of my professional software development time doing .NET development these past several years, I've come to know and love using the Castle Windsor IoC container (thanks to a friend and colleague who introduced it to our organization at the time).

When I started doing more Python development, for better or for worse I started trying to apply similar development patterns/techniques I used in .NET to Python, like (Dependency Injection)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection] via constructor arguments.
